/**
 * ServerStatusBeforeSplit
 * <p/>
 * Candidate for lock splitting
 * 
 * The other way to reduce the fraction of time that a lock is held (and
 * therefore the likelihood that it will be contended) is to have threads ask
 * for it less often. This can be accomplished by lock splitting and lock
 * striping, which involve using separate locks to guard multiple independent
 * state variables previously guarded by a single lock. These techniques reduce
 * the granularity at which locking occurs, potentially allowing greater
 * scalabilityâ€”but using more locks also increases the risk of deadlock.
 * 
 * As a thought experiment, imagine what would happen if there was only one lock
 * for the entire application instead of a separate lock for each object. Then
 * execution of all synchronized blocks, regardless of their lock, would be
 * serialized. With many threads competing for the global lock, the chance that
 * two threads want the lock at the same time increases, resulting in more
 * contention. So if lock requests were instead distributed over a larger set of
 * locks, there would be less contention. Fewer threads would be blocked waiting
 * for locks, thus increasing scalability.
 * 
 * If a lock guards more than one independent state variable, you may be able to
 * improve scalability by splitting it into multiple locks that each guard
 * different variables. This results in each lock being requested less often.
 * 
 * ServerStatus in Listing 11.6 shows a portion of the monitoring interface for
 * a database server that maintains the set of currently logged-on users and the
 * set of currently executing queries. As a user logs on or off or query
 * execution begins or ends, the ServerStatus object is updated by calling the
 * appropriate add or remove method. The two types of information are completely
 * independent; ServerStatus could even be split into two separate classes with
 * no loss of functionality.
