/*
 * In Binary Tree, Inorder successor of a TreeNode is the next TreeNode in Inorder
 * traversal of the Binary Tree. Inorder Successor is NULL for the last TreeNode
 * in Inoorder traversal. In Binary Search Tree, Inorder Successor of an
 * input TreeNode can also be defined as the TreeNode with the smallest key greater
 * than the key of input TreeNode. So, it is sometimes important to find next
 * TreeNode in sorted order.

 *  In the above diagram, inorder successor of 8 is 10, inorder successor of
 * 10 is 12 and inorder successor of 14 is 20.
 * 
 * Method 1 (Uses Parent Pointer) In this method, we assume that every
 * TreeNode has parent pointer.
 * 
 * The Algorithm is divided into two cases on the basis of right subtree of
 * the input TreeNode being empty or not.
 * 
 * Input: TreeNode, root // TreeNode is the TreeNode whose Inorder successor
 * is needed. output: succ // succ is Inorder successor of TreeNode.
 * 
 * 1) If right subtree of TreeNode is not NULL, then succ lies in right
 * subtree. Do following. Go to right subtree and return the TreeNode with
 * minimum key value in right subtree.
 * 
 * 2) If right sbtree of TreeNode is NULL, then succ is one of the
 * ancestors. Do following. Travel up using the parent pointer until you see
 * a TreeNode which is left child of itâ€™s parent. The parent of such a
 * TreeNode is the succ.
